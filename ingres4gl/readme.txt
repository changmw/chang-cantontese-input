Ingres RDBMS and Ingres4GL

Too bad, I had no chance of downloading my work from 
HP servers. It is in this little and short adventure
with China Light & Power (CLP) when I met an interesting
person Mr. Dion Wiggins. You can easily Google about
him now.

It was Mr. Wiggins who introduced and recommended me to 
the special project team in CLP, led by Mr. Entwistle.
I was then interviewed by Executive Leasing (Australia), 
and signed a temporary contact as an Application Developer.

Ingres RDBMS's SQL syntax was not very different from Foxpro.
But Ingres RDBMS was definitely way more expensive than Foxpro!
Foxpro also did NOT require HP X workstations, which were also
very expensive, more pricy than cheap personal computers
running Novell Netware LAN. :)

Looking back, Ingres4GL was very similar to Visual Foxpro. They
were both object-oriented and had similar user interfaces. But
when I was working in CLP, Visual Foxpro 3.0 was NOT yet born,
let alone its later upgrade to 6.0 then 9.0.

HP X workstations featured the use of TCP/IP, which led to the
blossom of WWW and internet, and eventual loss of business 
for Novell Netware.

An interesting thing about X protocol was remote control
and screen casting, very much like Remote Desktop in 
Windows now. It's graphical, unlike DOS.
