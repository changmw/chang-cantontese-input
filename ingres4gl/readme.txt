Ingres RDBMS and Ingres4GL

Too bad, I had no chance of downloading my work from 
HP servers. It is in this little and short adventure
with China Light & Power (CLP) when I met an interesting
person Mr. Dion Wiggins. You can easily Google about
him now.

It was Mr. Wiggins who introduced me to the project
team in CLP. I was then interviewed by Executive Leasing
(Australia), and signed a temporary contact as an
Application Developer.
