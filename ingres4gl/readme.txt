Ingres RDBMS and Ingres4GL

Too bad, I had no chance of downloading my work from 
HP servers. It is in this little and short adventure
with China Light & Power (CLP) when I met an interesting
person Mr. Dion Wiggins. You can easily Google about
him now.

It was Mr. Wiggins who introduced and recommended me to 
the special project team in CLP, led by Mr. Entwistle.
I was then interviewed by Executive Leasing (Australia), 
and signed a temporary contact as an Application Developer.
