Commands in the form of BASH script used to compile packages.

Note that ever since the arrival of package managers in various
Linux distributions (e.g. apt in Ubuntu, yum in Redhat, dnf in Fedora),
I no longer compile packages myself. But they are still ways to build
executables and libraries without losing features.
