iwconfig for wireless configuration

The iwconfig tool is like ifconfig and ethtool for wireless cards. You can view and set the basic Wi-Fi network details, such as the SSID, channel, and encryption. There's also many advanced settings you can view and change, including receive sensitivity, RTS/CTS, fragmentation, and retries. Here are some commands you may want to try:

Display the wireless settings of your interfaces, including the interface names you'll need for other commands:

    iwconfig

Set the ESSID (Extended Service Set Identifier) or network name:

    iwconfig <interface name> essid <network name>

    Example: iwconfig <interface name> "my network"

    Example: iwconfig <interface name> any

Set the wireless channel of the radio (1-11):

    iwconfig <interface name> <channel>

Input a WEP encryption key (WPA/WPA2 isn't supported yet; for this you need wpa_supplicant):

    iwconfig eth0 key <key in HEX format>

Only allow the adapter to connect to an AP with the MAC address you specify:

    iwconfig <interface name> ap <mac address>

    Example: iwconfig eth0 ap 00:60:1D:01:23:45

Set the transmit power of the radio, if supported by the wireless card, in dBm format by default or mW when specified:

    iwconfig <interface name> txpower <power level>

    Example: iwconfig eth0 txpower 15

    Example: iwconfig eth0 txpower 30mW
