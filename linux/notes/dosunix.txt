Converting UNIX to DOS and DOS to UNIXConverting UNIX to DOS and DOS to UNIX 
DOS/Windows format files and UNIX files often have a compatibility problem. 
That's because UNIX uses Control-J (^J) to demark the End-of-line character, and 
DOS uses Control-M (^M). So sometimes when you pull a DOS/Windows file onto a 
UNIX box, each line ends with a "^M", or sometimes you bring a UNIX file onto a 
DOS/Windows box and it looks like there are no end-of-line demarcations.
There are several ways to convert a DOS file to UNIX format, or vice versa. One 
such way would be thus, to convert a DOS/Windows text file into a Solaris UNIX 
file:
tr -d '\015' < filein.dos > fileout.unix 
another way is:
sed 's/^V^M//g' filein.dos > fileout.unix
