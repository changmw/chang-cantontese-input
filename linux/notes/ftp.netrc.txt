Ftp transfers can be automated. The Expect program can be used to
recursively descend sub-directories, etc. Or, you can use ftp's .netrc
file. The .netrc file must be in the home directory of the user invoking
ftp, and must not be readable or writable by other users. Here's an
example .netrc file:

machine oldbox login root passwd rootpass
macdef init
hash
prompt off
mget *.cgi

macdef myget
cd somedir
mget *.data
cdup

The "macdef" keyword defines a macro. Macros are executed by typing the
name preceded by a "$"; the "init" macro is executed automatically after
login. See "man netrc" for more information.


Below is the contents of an automatic ftp script I found on the Internet.
 I've been using it for several months and it works great.  Make the script
 executable and run it from cron.  Obviously, you'll need to change "get"
 for "put".  It does whatever ftp commands you give it until it reaches the
 EOF.

=============================
#!/bin/sh
ftp -n yourNTserver <<EOF
user anonymous password yourname@domain.com
binary
hash
prompt
get firstfile.xls
get secondfile.xls
get thirdfile.xls
EOF
