Try adding
disable spoolss = yes
to global and
use client driver = no
to your print share.

Adding "use client driver = yes" to the configuration of the Printer
Share in "smb.conf" should solve the problem

that include "write list" and "printer admin" that can be changed to
get rid of the access denials
