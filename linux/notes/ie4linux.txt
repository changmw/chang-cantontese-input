You have to enable universe packages first. It is also recommended that you use the official winehq ubuntu package:

Open /etc/apt/sources.list file

$sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list

Uncomment following lines in your /etc/apt/sources.list and it may be different if you are in different country instead of UK

Currently, wine only have i386 binary packages available. If you do not use an i386 architecture, or wish to compile the package in a special or optimized way, you can build the wine package using the source repository instead. To do this, add a source repository with one of the following:

deb-src http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/apt dapper main

Close gedit and run an update to take your new Repository

$sudo apt-get update

Install wine and cabextract

$sudo apt-get install wine cabextract
