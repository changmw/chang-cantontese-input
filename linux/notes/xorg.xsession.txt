On Debian you would change the file /etc/X11/Xsession.d/99x11-common_start. In stock form there is a line that reads:

   exec $STARTUP

Change that to read:

   exec firefox javascript:%20resizeTo\(1024,768\)

and your machine will boot directly into Firefox at a screen size of 1024x768. Of course you can change the size to any resolution you like. You can probably also add more javascript as well and force opening a web page and other stuff. Combine this with Bastille and an autologin of a non-privileged user and you'll have a very convenient (and cheap) kiosk.
