# wl passive 1
# to go back to normal mode type:
# wl passive 0
# when setting passive to 1 you are putting the router into passive scan mode, 
# by default the router is in active scan mode.
# In active mode the router detects other APs by sending a packet and waiting 
# for response. Only the Aps that send a response are showed in the site survey page.
# In passive mode the router just listens for packets from every AP.

# Feb 29, 2024 More bug-fixing; learning Awk programming, notably escaping special characters
# Mar 02, 2024 Use sed to change field delimiters in the output of site_survey
# Mar 03, 2024 Rearranged columns, add Seen/Iteration column.
# Mar 19, 2024 Instead of converting square braces in the ouput of site_survey command 
#              to curly ones, convert them to tab the non-printable character!

# SSID Naming Conventions
# https://www.cisco.com/assets/sol/sb/WAP321_Emulators/WAP321_Emulator_v1.0.0.3/help/Wireless05.html
# 
# The SSID (Service Set Identifier) can be any alphanumeric, case-sensitive entry from 2 to 32 characters.
# The printable characters plus the space (ASCII 0x20) are allowed, but
# these six characters are not: ?, ", $, [, \, ], and +.
#
# Because the site_survey command of DD-WRT uses "[" and "]" as field separators,
# the following SSID names will break this program when using them as Awk field separators:
#
# 1. "[LG_StickVacuum]xxxx"
# [code][ 2] SSID[[LG_StickVacuum]e6cb] BSSID[82:5B:65:68:E6:CB][....[/code]
#
#
# How do I pull the value between curly braces?
# https://www.unix.com/unix-for-dummies-questions-and-answers/229865-how-do-i-pull-value-between-curly-braces.html
# awk \'$1=="pid"{print $2}\' FS=\{ RS=\} file
#
# To call sed within the Awk vaariable, need to escape:
# 1. "]" to "\\]"
# 2. "[" to "\\["
# 3. "'" to "'\''"
# 
# Trimming spaces via calling sed::
#
# cmd="echo " $4 " | sed -e s/[[:blank:]]//g";
# cmd | getline result;
# close(cmd);
# name[bssid]=result;
