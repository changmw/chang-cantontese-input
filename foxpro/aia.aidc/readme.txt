American International Data Center Co. (subsidary of AIA)

I ported an insurance agent system written in Clipper 
Summer 87 to Foxpro for Windows, with file transfer to/from
AIA's mainframe computers. For this project, I reported 
directly to Ms. Patricia Po.

PLAS.PRG contained miscellaneous library functions for all
applications of PLAS (Motor, Home).

PLAS stood for Personal Lines Administration System.

Unlike Visaul Foxpro, Foxpro for Windows required you
to use GENSCRN to gernerate actual Foxpro codes from 
screen and menu definition files painted with screen 
and menu designer. It did saved you sometime from using
@...SAY...GET... PICTURE.

With the arrival of smartphones and tablets, this PLAS
front-end insurance agent system should have been 
replaced with Android and iOS apps. Before that, Java
should have been used to produce a PLAS-like system
accessible from all kinds of web browsers.

Lastly, some insurance companies might out-source 
insurance agent system to small, independent software
companies.
