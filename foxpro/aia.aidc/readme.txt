American International Data Center Co. (subsidary of AIA)

I ported an insurance agent system written in Clipper 
Summer 87 to Foxpro for Windows, with file transfer to/from
AIA's mainframe computers. For this project, I reported 
directly to Ms. Patricia Po.

PLAS.PRG contained miscellaneous library functions for all
applications of PLAS (Motor, Home).

PLAS stood for Personal Lines Administration System.

Unlike Visaul Foxpro, Foxpro for Windows required you
to use GENSCRN to gernerate actual Foxpro codes from 
screen and menu definition file painted with screen 
and menu designer.
