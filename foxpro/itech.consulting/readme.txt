i-Tech Consulting systems

Mr. Rodney Lai was then the boss who interviewed and hired me.
I wrote Visual Foxpro applications with Microsoft SQL Server
integration. The biggest project was moving a mini-computer
POS system for ChinaCity Night Club to Visual Foxpro and SQL
Server. The mini-computer system used a 4GL kind of tool 
called Mantis.
