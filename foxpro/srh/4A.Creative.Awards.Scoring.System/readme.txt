4A Creative Awards Scoring System writte in Clipper, 
instead of Foxpro. I forgot why I chose Clipper over
Foxpro... most likely because of its speed and compact
executable size over Foxpro!

old4a.rmk was the Makefile for BLINKER.EXE.

Back then, I didn't know what 4A meant. :)

I just coded this system, installed it to a computer,
took it with a dot-matrix printer to a big hotel in Admiralty, 
and over-watched the data entry process. The judges 
(including foreigners, e.g. Japanese) would write down their 
scores on papers which was input into my system and produce 
scoring sheets.
