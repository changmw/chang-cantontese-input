Management Infomration Systems for Survey Research Hongkong

SRH's mother company Survey Research Group was acquired by
AC Nielsen sometime in year 1994. I suspect AC Nielssen was
after the client database and data archive of SRH & SRG,
more than their employees.

I left SRH for a little and short adventure in the Tuen Mun power 
plant of China Light & Power, working with HP Unix workstations,
Ingres4GL and Ingres RDBMS. So I really didn't know what happened 
to my colleagues in MIS Team after the acquisition.

BTW, before I left SRH, the MIS Team of Data Processing Department
was promoted into MIS Department.
