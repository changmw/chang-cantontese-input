Mailing List System for Survey Research Hongkong,
written in Foxpro for DOS. This system was used
by the only librarian of the Company.

Actual database was not included because of
the confidentiality of customer/client records.
It should not be defficult to re-create the
database based on the source codes.

Main program is MAILLIST.PRG.

This system was initally written by Mr. Kai-wing Fung,
who was a programmer in the MIS team of the Data Processing 
Department.

Mr. Fung left the company for studying about theology. That's
also why I was recruited as a replacement programmer in the
MIS Team.
