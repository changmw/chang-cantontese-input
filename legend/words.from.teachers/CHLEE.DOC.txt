It is a great pleasure to see you, the first cohort of the degree 
course, finally completed you studies and be rewarded with honours. 
The course you have gone through the CPHK has a wide scoped one which 
I believe, coupled with you maturing over these four years, will equip 
you with the fundamental skills to develop useful functions and a 
successful career in the information technology areas. You will no 
doubt, develop sharper and deeper skills in specific areas. However, 
there is always the danger of loosing touch as one settle to easier 
life. I hope you will always keep yourself up-to-date by whatever 
means you choose, e.g. by joining professional organisation and get 
technically involved.

Since you are young, you have good capacity to develop sense of humour 
and pleasant attitude of service. I also hope that you will have time, 
as you were suppose to have during your studies, to think and to re-examine 
your values, and to relax. After all, you are still relatively free 
and there are things that you might not be able to do later in your 
life when you are more constrainted.

As you begin a new chapter, I want to congradulate you on your achievement 
and wish you best luck in your future endeavor.
