Subject: Letter from Net700 to IC.

Hello George,

As you should know about the case  of  Net700,  and  I  want  to
condemn   my  Zone  Co-ordinator  about  this  case  as  he  was
acknowledged and support the wrong decision of R61C and the  new
appointed Net700C.

As  I  believe,  the re-engineering process should be, provide a
take over process from the former NC to him, and there should be
nothing  changed  to  the lower level. But the new appointed NC,
failed to take-over the job from  the  former  NC,  and  try  to
remove  all nodes in order to get the information from us. After
a meeting of NET700, we confirmed that  we  deeply  condemn  our
Coordinators use this dirty tricks to win his power.

And  for  this case, we tried to send netmail to our Z6C, Honlin
Lue, but he refused all netmail which was  written  in  English,
and willing to answer all the complain in Chinese in the Chinese
echomail. He is  trying  to  escape  the  official  language  in
FidoNET in order to bend on the RC/NC.

Please take a look on the following translation from his mail,

If  he made mistake, I will ask him to correct, and will forgive
him.

This is correct.  Policy4 does not give NC  any  power.   If  it
affects your right, you don't have to accept it.

But  Policy4 said out-going NC will provide information of nodes
to the new NC.  If the new NC delete any node  because  he  does
not have sufficient information, this is understandable.

We  only  communicate through e-mail.  If the identity cannot be
confirmed, we can't be sure who is the writer of the mail.

An extreme situation is when a person is NC and he made a number
of  false  nodes.   Or  a  few  dozens phoney BBS.  Although the
telephone numbers in the nodelist is  real,  who  can  ascertain
that the sysop of the BBS is real.

NC not just can delete nodes which have been down for two weeks.
He can also delete BBS who made false nodelist or do not use the
latest nodelist.

As  I  know,  Policy4 request us to use the update nodelist. But
our ZC said that if we don't use the update nodelist,  our  node
can be removed. It is true that we have responsibilty to use the
update nodelist. But not forced us to use the  latest  otherwise
our  node  will  be  removed.  And  ALL  the NET700 nodes in the
nodelist were real  and  offical.  ZC  cannot  doubt  about  the
nodelist's reality.

Also  when  his RC made a mistake, he will forgive him, but when
nodes at his lower level made a mistake, he will dismiss him. It
is  obviously  to see that our ZC is fully protect his appointed
staffs either he is doing  something  wrong,  like  dismiss  ALL
nodes in NET700.

I  think  you  also agree that we, operating a BBS, is basically
for interest. But now our Co-ordinators treat this as a game for
politics  and  power.  We  hate  this  intention and condemn all
levels of our Co-ordinators.

Besides for NET700, all the  product  support  site,  which  was
based  on  NET700 was also removed from the Zone list. Like mine
6:6/108 and 6:6/109, the Asia  support  site  for  QuickBBS  and
ALLfix.  I  fully believe that the Z6C/R61C/N700C parties has an
intention to remove all HONG KONG FidoNET nodes  neither  it  is
NET700  or  not,  and  then accept those who will not oppose, or
support their dictatorship management, back to the nodelist.

I fully hope that you can leave us a mail, at least we  can  see
your  decision in NET700 very soon. You decision will safe about
600 active nodes, 300 private nodes in NET700, a  network  which
the size is competitive with a state in US.
