Data Dictionary System using dBase III+ for DOS to aid a course assignment
about system analysis for a bogus supermarket. The tutor was Mr. Lee Clubb.

It's not a homework, but my voluntary effort. It turned the task of producing
the data dictionary into form filling. Back then, there was no hard disks but
1.44M floppy diskettes.
